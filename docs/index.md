# RL class @ MVA

Welcome to the website of the reinforcement learning class for the [MVA master program](https://www.master-mva.com/).

# Schedule

This class is joint work between [Emmanuel Rachelson](https://people.isae-supaero.fr/emmanuel-rachelson) (first 6 sessions) and [Emilie Kaufmann](https://emiliekaufmann.github.io/) (2 last ones).

This tentative schedule is designed around 3-hours sessions.

Schedule | |
| --- | --- |
| Session 1 | General introduction |
|           | Markov Decision Processes |
|           | Formulating the optimization problem(s) |
| Session 2 | Approximate Dynamic Programming |
| Session 3 |

# Syllabus

This class aims at providing a comprehensive and modern introduction to reinforcement learning concepts and algorithms.

1. Define reinforcement learning as learning to control a dynamic system
1.1 Going further 
2. Describe the system to control as a Markov decision process
3. Define policies, value functions and optimality (1st theorem here)
4. Characterize optimal value functions via the Bellman equations (2 theorems here)
