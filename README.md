# RL class @ MVA

Welcome to the website of the reinforcement learning class for the [MVA master program](https://www.master-mva.com/).  
This class is joint work between [Emmanuel Rachelson](https://people.isae-supaero.fr/emmanuel-rachelson) (first 6 sessions) and [Emilie Kaufmann](https://emiliekaufmann.github.io/) (2 last ones).

## Syllabus

This class aims at providing a comprehensive and modern introduction to reinforcement learning concepts and algorithms. It is structured around several chapters, each covered in a separate notebook.

Chapter 0: Reinforcement Learning class introduction; key intuitions  
Chapter 1: Modeling sequential decision problems with Markov Decision Processes  
Chapter 2: Characterizing value functions: the Bellman equations  
Chapter 3: Learning value functions  
Chapter 4: Deep Q-Networks  
Chapter 5: Continuous actions in DQN algorithms  
Chapter 6: Direct policy search and policy gradient methods  
TBC: chapters on bandits, exploration, MCTS and alphaGo  

##Â Class material

Notebooks for the first 6 chapters are accessible at [https://github.com/erachelson/RLclass_MVA](https://github.com/erachelson/RLclass_MVA). Please download the latest version before class.

## Schedule for 2023-24

The schedule is designed around 3-hours sessions. It might be adjusted depending on the progression of classes.

Session 1 should cover chapters 0 to 2.  
Session 2: chapter 3.  
Session 3: chapter 4.  
Session 4: chapter 5.  
Session 5: chapter 6.  
Session 6 is kept unassigned for now, to preserve the possibility to use it as a buffer to avoid rushing through previous sessions.  
Session 7 and 8: stochastic bandits, monte carlo tree search and alphaGo.  

## Homework

Each notebook contains homework that help play with the concepts introduced in class, to better grasp them. Most exercises come with solutions. The homework also introduces additional important notions. They are a full and important part to reach the class goals. Often, the provided answer reaches out further than the plain question asked and provides comments, additional insights, or external references.

## Evaluation

The final grade will be composed of three parts (coefficients TBD).  
1. Between session 2 and session 6 (included), a short mandatory online 10-15 minutes quiz will be run at the beginning of class, on the contents of the previous session. These quizes will be graded and will count towards the final grade.  
2. An implementation project around session 6 will also be graded.  
3. An independant assignment on the last two sessions will finally be graded.
