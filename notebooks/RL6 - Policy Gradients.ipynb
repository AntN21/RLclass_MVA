    "The previous chapters have focussed on *action-value methods*; they aimed at estimating $Q^*$ in order to deduce $\\pi^*$, or they jointly optimized $Q$ and $\\pi$. Could we directly optimize $\\pi$?\n",
    "\n",

    "- $\\pi_\\theta$ might not be able to represent $\\pi^*$. We will take a shortcut and call $\\pi^*$ the best policy among the $\\pi_\\theta$ ones.\n",
    "- for discrete state and action space, the tabular policy representation is a special case of policy parameterization.\n",
    "- policy parameterization is a (possibly useful) way of introducing prior knowledge on the set of the desired policies.\n",
    "- the optimal deterministic policies might not belong to the policy subspace of $\\pi_\\theta$, thus it makes sense to consider stochastic policies for $\\pi_\\theta$.\n",
    "- for problems with significant policy approximation, the best approximate policy (among $\\pi_\\theta$ ones) may very well be stochastic.\n",
    "- it makes even more sense to consider stochastic policies that it opens the family of environments that we can tackle, like partially observable MDPs or multi-player games.\n",
    "\n",
    "For stochastic policies, we shall write $\\pi_\\theta(a|s)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of the chapter, we will assume that $\\pi_\\theta$ is differentiable with respect to $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose now we define some performance metric $J(\\pi_\\theta) = J(\\theta)$. If $J$ is differentiable and a stochastic estimate $\\nabla_\\theta J(\\theta)$ of the gradient is available, then we can define the gradient ascent update procedure:\n",

    "- Note that $J$ is a generic criterion. For example, $J$ could be defined as the value of a starting state (or a distribution of starting states), or as the undiscounted reward over a certain horizon, or as the average reward.\n",
    "- Why is it interesting to look at policy gradient methods? Because for continuous actions there is no maximization step ($\\max_a Q(s,a)$) during evaluation but only a call to $\\pi_\\theta(s)$ (or a draw from $\\pi_\\theta(a|s)$). This makes Policy Gradient a method of choice for continuous actions domains (especially common in Robotics).\n",
    "- When do policy gradient approaches outperform value-based ones? It's hard to give a precise criterion; it really depends on the problem. One thing that comes into play is how easy it is to approximate the optimal policy or the optimal value function. If one is simpler than the other (by \"simpler\", we mean \"it is easier to find a parameterization whose spanned function space almost includes the function to approximate\"), then it is a good heuristic to try to approximate it. But this criterion might itself be hard to assess.\n"
